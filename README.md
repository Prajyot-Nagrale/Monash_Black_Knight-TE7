Project Title: Black Knight - M-Safe

Overview:

M-Safe (Monash – Safe) is dedicated to ensuring safe travel during night hours for Monash international students around Melbourne CBD. Our goal is to provide students new to the city with safe route recommendations during late hours, prioritizing their safety and convenience.

Introduction:

Nighttime travel can often be risky, with incidents like robbery, mugging, car accidents, and other safety concerns being more prevalent during these hours. M-Safe aims to support Monash international students by recommending the safest walking or biking routes around Melbourne CBD, especially for those unfamiliar with the area. Our solution addresses the challenges of night travel when public transport options are limited.

Getting Started:

We are developing “M-Safe,” a web application designed to offer safe route suggestions for Monash students around Melbourne CBD. This project document covers our progress across Iterations 1 and 2, detailing the analysis, design, and features. Key functionalities include:

	•	Safe Route Suggestions: Identify and recommend secure walking/biking paths based on safety features like cameras and streetlights.
	•	Late Night Dining Options: List nearby 24/7 restaurants, providing essential information on their availability.
	•	Customer Support: Offer a support function to assist users with queries and concerns.

Execution Plan:

	1.	Crime Data Analysis: Crime reports were primarily available by suburbs, not specific locations. Our approach adjusted to analyze data by suburbs and crime categories.
	2.	Restaurant Data: While restaurant locations were accessible, their operating hours were not. We manually included data for establishments open during late hours.
	3.	Safest Route Mapping: Utilizing data on street cameras and lighting, we mapped out safe routes. Despite the lack of exact crime location data, we leveraged available safety infrastructure to provide route suggestions.

Data preprocessing, cleaning, and merging were done using Python and R. The processed dataset will be made available as an open dataset on our GitHub, encouraging transparency and further research.
