Project Title:

We at M-Safe (Monash – Safe) are here to cater for your needs for safe travel during the night. Our aim is to help students who are new to Melbourne CBD with the safest route they can take during midnight hours. Your safety is our priority.


Introduction:

There has been a constant worry about safety in travelling at night. It is not just paranoia, it is dangerous to travel in the night hours with events like robbery, mugging, car crash, stealing, alcohol abuse, etc have been reported more during the night hours than the day. Here, we are trying to take one step ahead and focusing on helping Monash International Students, with recommendations on some safety routes and measures, who choose to walk or bicycle their way around Melbourne CBD. International students who are not familiar with the routes around Melbourne CBD might have difficulties choosing the best route that is safe to take at any chosen time especially at the night hours when there will be almost no public transports available.


Getting Started:

We aim to provide a comprehensive solution for the prevailing night crimes in and around Melbourne City, that has an impact on night travel in the city, by recommending the safest route to walk /Bicycle. Our primary goal is to help Monash International Students who are not familiar with the streets around Melbourne City to travel safely at midnight hours.

This document contains the information of our project’s analysis and design details at a stage of iteration 1 and 2. We will be delivering a website - “Msafe”, which is designed to provide night safety route suggestions for the Monash international students who live around Melbourne CBD. This document shows the structure of our project as well as our understanding of deliverables. It is a comprehensive reflection of our periodic achievements for Iteration 1. We will be delivering functionalities that include Suggesting a safe road for students around Melbourne CBD at night, Offer the choice of restaurant with its information on availability from 11 PM to 5 AM and finally a customer services function that will help the users get any help or information needed.


Executing program:

1.	CRIME REPORTED: We got crime reported with respect according to suburbs but not in the location. Because of this, we must change our analysis of the report with suburbs and different categories.
2.	RESTAURANTS: We found all restaurants data in Melbourne CBD, but it didn’t have open and close timing. Our main solution of the website is for the night, so the timings of restaurants were important for us. So, we manually had to find some restaurants which are open 24/7 and must include them in the dataset
3.	SAFEST ROUTE: We got the dataset that had the camera and streetlight for the exact location, but we didn’t get the data for a crime that happened in the exact location. We still could be able to find the safest route with the help of cameras and streetlights.
The dataset used for this project is raw, so it needs to collaborate with other datasets. This would require cleaning and wrangling the dataset in Python or R coding language. After finding a way to merge the dataset we would like to provide this dataset as open datasets which could be downloaded from our GitHub server. We will make sure the datasets used for the project are open datasets and can be used for visualization.
